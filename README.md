# the-todo-project

This project is focussed on understanding core concepts involved in building web applications with Javscript.
We will try to use vanilla javascript and avoid use of frameworks as much as possible.

The goal is to build a todo app that will allow users to -
1) add tasks
2) mark tasks as completed
3) delete completed tasks
4) Create lists of tasks
5) Manage lists

As the app matures, we will add more layers like -
- Componentizing the app
- Saving tasks in db
- Authentication & Authorization
- User Session Management
- PWA
- Setting up CI & CD workflow
- Writing automation Tests
